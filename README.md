# Cuneiform-OCR
This repository contains code for line detection, character detection and recognition on the cuneiform 2d images 

Each folder contains the respective code for:

* **Line Detection**: Using Image processing techniques, line intendations are found on Cuneiform rgb images. To compile: [README](https://github.com/cdli-gh/Cuneiform-OCR/tree/master/line_detection), For the theory: [Wiki](https://github.com/cdli-gh/Cuneiform-OCR/wiki/Line-detection-for-Cuneiform-tablet-images-using-image-processing-techniques)

* **Object Detection**: Using maskrcnn Cuneiform characters and line intendations are found on Cuneiform rgb images. To compile: [README](https://github.com/cdli-gh/Cuneiform-OCR/tree/master/object-detection/Mask_RCNN), For the theory: [Wiki](https://github.com/cdli-gh/Cuneiform-OCR/wiki/Character-Detection)

* **Synthetic**: To create synthetic cuneiform rgb images with annotations for maskrcnn training. To compile: [README](https://github.com/cdli-gh/Cuneiform-OCR/tree/master/synthetic), For the theory: [Wiki](https://github.com/cdli-gh/Cuneiform-OCR/wiki/Synthetic-Image-data-generation)
